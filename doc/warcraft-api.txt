INTRODUCTION                                                    *warcraft-api.nvim*

warcraft-api.nvim is a plugin which adds the World of Warcraft Lua API reference
to your LSP (lua_ls only for now).

This plugin downloads the API bindings from
`https://github.com/Ketho/vscode-wow-api` and simply points the LSP clients to
the definitions.
It extends your current LSP settings with the new library path and restores
the old settings when not in use so as not to affect your global settings.

Full credit to `https://github.com/Ketho` for the hard work they have put in.

Getting started:
  1. Run `:checkhealth warcraft-api` to ensure everything is installed
  2. Run `:WarcraftApi enable` in your WoW addon project to enable the API
  bindings
    2.1 This will download the API definitions and point the LSP to them
  3. Run `:WarcraftApi disable` to disable the plugin in the current project
  4. Run `:WarcraftApi update` to update the API definitions to the latest
  version
